# SPIDERGAP CHALLENGE

The SpiderGap Challenge consists of two coding challenges which have been addressed with the functions below

## DEEP CLONE

This is a function that creates a deep clone of any object passed as a parameter. This function is the default export from from ./deep_clone and takes in an object as a parameter. It returns a clone

## PARTNERS DISTANCE FILTER

This is a function that searches the json file provided [here](https://success.spidergap.com/partners.json) to find the names and addresses of any partners whose offices are closer than 100km to Central London (coordinates 51.515419, -0.141099). 
This function is the default export from ./partners_distance_filter and does not take in any parameters. It returns an array containing the partner organisations that fulfill the above criteria, sorted in ascending order

No third party packages other than Mocha were used anywhere in the project.
