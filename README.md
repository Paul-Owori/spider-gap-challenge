# SPIDERGAP CHALLENGE

The SpiderGap Challenge consists of two coding challenges which have been addressed with the functions below

## DEEP CLONE

This is a function that creates a deep clone of any object passed as a parameter

## PARTNERS DISTANCE FILTER

This is a function that searches the json file provided [here](https://success.spidergap.com/partners.json) to find the names and addresses of any partners whose offices are closer than 100km to Central London (coordinates 51.515419, -0.141099)

No third party packages other than Mocha were used anywhere in the project.
